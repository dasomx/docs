## Introduction

The Leads feature in OKChat AI allows you to collect valuable user information such as name, email, and phone number from individuals who interact with your chatbot. This information is crucial for follow-ups, marketing campaigns, and customer relationship management.

## Enabling the Request User Info Option

To start collecting leads, you need to enable the "Request User Info" option in your chatbot settings.

### Steps to Enable Request User Info:

1. **Log in to OKChat AI**: Access your OKChat AI dashboard.
2. **Navigate to Chatbot Settings**: Go to the "Settings" section of your chatbot.
3. **Enable Request User Info**: Find the "Request User Info" option and toggle it to enable.
4. **Save Changes**: Ensure you save the settings to apply the changes.

## Collecting User Information

Once the "Request User Info" option is enabled, your chatbot will prompt users to provide their information during interactions. The collected data includes:

- **Name**: The user's full name.
- **Email**: The user's email address.
- **Phone**: The user's phone number.
- **Platform**: The platform through which the user interacted with the chatbot (e.g., Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp).

## Managing Leads

### Accessing Leads:

1. **Navigate to Leads Section**: In your OKChat AI dashboard, go to the "Leads" section under "Conversations."
2. **View Collected Leads**: You will see a list of all collected leads with details such as name, email, phone, platform, and date of interaction.

### Filtering and Exporting Leads:

- **Filter by Name**: Use the search bar to filter leads by name.
- **Export Leads**: Click on the "Export" button to download the leads data in a CSV format for further analysis or integration with other tools.

## Best Practices

- **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure that you comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) when collecting and storing user information.
- **Clear Communication**: Inform users about why their information is being collected and how it will be used.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Regularly check the leads section to follow up with potential customers promptly.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Leads Collected**: If no leads are appearing, ensure that the "Request User Info" option is enabled and that users are being prompted correctly.
- **Incomplete Information**: If users are not providing complete information, consider revising the chatbot's prompts to make it clearer what information is required.

## Conclusion

The Leads feature in OKChat AI is a powerful tool for gathering user information that can help you enhance your marketing efforts and improve customer engagement. By enabling the "Request User Info" option and managing the collected data effectively, you can build a robust database of potential leads to support your business goals.
