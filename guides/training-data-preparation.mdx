## Content Quality Guidelines

### Preventing Hallucinations

1. **Explicit References**

   - Replace pronouns with specific nouns
   - Examples:
     - ❌ "It provides fast shipping"
     - ✅ "Amazon Prime provides fast shipping"
     - ❌ "They can help with returns"
     - ✅ "Customer service representatives can help with returns"

2. **Specific Quantities and Metrics**

   - Use exact numbers when possible
   - Include units of measurement
   - Examples:
     - ❌ "Delivery takes a few days"
     - ✅ "Delivery takes 3-5 business days"
     - ❌ "The product is quite large"
     - ✅ "The product dimensions are 10" x 12" x 15""

3. **Clear Entity References**

   - Avoid ambiguous references
   - Name specific products, services, or departments
   - Examples:
     - ❌ "Contact support for assistance"
     - ✅ "Contact technical support at support@company.com for assistance"
     - ❌ "Use the tool to analyze data"
     - ✅ "Use the Google Analytics dashboard to analyze website traffic data"

4. **Temporal Clarity**
   - Specify exact dates or time periods
   - Use absolute references instead of relative ones
   - Examples:
     - ❌ "The feature was recently added"
     - ✅ "The feature was added in January 2024"
     - ❌ "Updates coming soon"
     - ✅ "Updates scheduled for Q2 2024"

### Writing Style Guidelines

1. **Factual Language**

   - Use concrete, verifiable statements
   - Avoid subjective descriptions
   - Examples:
     - ❌ "The best solution for your needs"
     - ✅ "A solution that offers features A, B, and C"
     - ❌ "Amazing performance improvements"
     - ✅ "30% faster response time compared to version 1.0"

2. **Consistent Terminology**

   - Maintain a glossary of approved terms
   - Use the same term for the same concept
   - Examples:
     - ❌ "login, sign-in, log in" (mixing terms)
     - ✅ "login" (consistent usage)
     - ❌ "customer, user, client" (mixing terms)
     - ✅ "user" (consistent usage)

3. **Structured Information**

   - Break down complex concepts
   - Use lists and tables for clarity
   - Include step-by-step instructions
   - Example:

     ```markdown
     To reset your password:

     1. Navigate to login.company.com
     2. Click "Forgot Password"
     3. Enter your email address
     4. Follow the instructions in the reset email
     ```

4. **Context Completeness**
   - Include all necessary context in each answer
   - Avoid assuming prior knowledge
   - Examples:
     - ❌ "Enable the feature in settings"
     - ✅ "Enable the dark mode feature in User Settings > Display > Theme"
     - ❌ "Use the API key to authenticate"
     - ✅ "Use the API key from your dashboard at api.company.com/keys to authenticate requests"
