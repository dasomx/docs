## Getting Started with AI Voice Agent

## Getting Started Steps

### 1. Accessing the AI Voice Agent

Log in to your OKChat AI dashboard.

Navigate to the **AI Voice Agent** section under **Integration**.

If you do not see this option, contact [info@dasomx.com](mailto:info@dasomx.com) to request access.

### 2. General Configuration

In the **General** tab, you can configure the core behavior of your voice agent.

- **Prompt:** Set the system prompt to define the agent's personality and instructions.
- **Voice Provider:** Choose between **OKCHAT (Recommended)**, **OpenAI Realtime**, or **Gemini Live**. The OKCHAT provider offers the most customization options.
- **LLM Provider (OKCHAT only):** If you chose the OKCHAT provider, select an underlying Large Language Model (LLM) provider like OpenAI, Google, or Groq.
- **Model:** Choose the specific model for the selected provider (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `gemini-2.0-flash`).
- **Turn Detector:** Select how the agent detects user speech: **English**, **Multilingual**, or **Push To Talk** (deprecated).
- **TTS Provider (OKCHAT only):** Choose a Text-to-Speech provider like OpenAI, Google, ElevenLabs, Deepgram, or Cartesia to generate the agent's voice.
- **Choose AI Voice:** Select a specific voice from the chosen TTS provider's library.
- **STT Provider:** Select a Speech-to-Text provider like OpenAI, Deepgram, Speechmatics, Groq, or Google for transcription.
- **STT Model:** Choose the specific transcription model.
- **Language:** Enable **Auto-detect language** or manually specify language codes (e.g., `en` for ISO 639-1, `en-US` for BCP-47, depending on the STT provider).
- **Keywords:** Provide a comma-separated list of domain-specific keywords to improve speech recognition accuracy.
- **Greeting Message:** Set the initial message the agent speaks when a conversation starts.
- **Voice Vibe:** Describe the desired personality, tone, and speaking style for the AI voice, particularly for OpenAI voices.

### 3. Appearance, Text, and Avatar

Customize the visual aspects of your voice widget.

- **Appearance Tab:** Adjust colors (background, text, button), radius for cards and buttons, and the widget's on-screen **position** (`bottom-right`, `top-left`, etc.). You can also choose to hide the "Powered by OKCHAT.AI" watermark.
- **Text Tab:** Customize the text for buttons and status indicators like "Start call" or "Listening...".
- **Avatar Tab:** Upload a custom image to be used as the agent's avatar.

### 4. Advanced Configuration

Fine-tune the agent's performance from the **Config** tab.

- **VAD Threshold:** Adjust VAD sensitivity (0-1). Lower is more sensitive. Default: 0.5.
- **Prefix Padding (ms):** Minimum speech duration to start a chunk. Default: 500ms.
- **Silence Duration (ms):** Minimum silence before ending a segment. Default: 1000ms.
- **Temperature:** Adjust response randomness (0-1). Higher is more random. Default: 0.7.
- **Max Output Tokens:** Limit response length. Default: 2048 tokens.

### 5. Kiosk Mode

Configure a full-screen voice agent experience, ideal for public displays.

- Enable **Kiosk Mode** from the **Kiosk** tab.
- Customize the **Onboarding Screen** with a title, description, instructions, and brand colors.
- Upload a mascot image and set the button text.
- Use the provided **Kiosk URL** to launch the agent in a browser.

### 6. Telephony Integration

Connect your voice agent to phone lines from the **Telephony** tab. This allows users to call in and interact with your AI agent over the phone.

### 7. Embedding the Voice Widget

Copy the embed code from the bottom of the configuration page and paste it into your website's HTML. The `data-position` attribute can be configured in the Appearance tab.

```html
<script
  src="https://v2.okchat.ai/chatbot-voice-widget.js"
  data-chatbot-id="YOUR_CHATBOT_ID"
  data-position="bottom-right"
