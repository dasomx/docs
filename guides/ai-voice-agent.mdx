## Getting Started with AI Voice Agent

### 1. **Accessing the AI Voice Agent**

- Log in to your OKChat AI dashboard.
- Navigate to the **AI Voice Agent Widget** section under **Integration**.
- If you do not see this option, contact **info@dasomx.com** to request access to the preview feature.

### 2. **Configuring the Voice Widget**

- Customize the voice widget to suit your needs:
  - **Avatar**: Choose an avatar for the voice widget.
  - **Text**: Customize the text displayed in the widget.
  - **Appearance**: Adjust the widget's visual appearance (e.g., colors, size).
  - **Voice**: Select the voice type and tone for the AI Voice Agent.

### 3. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD) Settings**

- **VAD Threshold**: Adjust the sensitivity of speech detection (default: 0.5). Lower values make the widget more sensitive to speech.
- **Prefix Padding (ms)**: Set the minimum duration of speech required to start a new speech chunk (default: 500ms).
- **Silence Duration (ms)**: Define the minimum duration of silence before ending the speech segment (default: 1000ms).

### 4. **Response Settings**

- **Temperature**: Adjust the randomness of the AI's responses (default: 0.7). Higher values make responses more creative, while lower values make them more deterministic.
- **Max Output Tokens**: Limit the length of the chatbot's responses (default: 2048 tokens). One token roughly corresponds to one word.

### 5. **Embedding the Voice Widget**

- Copy the embed code provided in the widget configuration section.
- Paste the code into your website's HTML to enable the voice widget.
- Example embed code:
  ```html
  <script
    src="http://localhost:3000/chatbot-voice-widget.js"
    data-chatbot-id="5afe16ed-5fd2-4552-a993-903bc9c32bb6"
  ></script>
  ```

## Best Practices

- **Test Thoroughly**: Test the voice widget in different environments to ensure accurate speech recognition.
- **Optimize VAD Settings**: Adjust the VAD threshold, prefix padding, and silence duration to match your use case.
- **Monitor Performance**: Regularly review the chatbot's responses and adjust the temperature and max output tokens as needed.
- **User Guidance**: Provide clear instructions to users on how to interact with the voice widget.

## Troubleshooting

  - Ensure the embed code is correctly placed in your website's HTML.
  - Check the VAD settings to ensure the widget is sensitive enough to detect speech.
- **Inaccurate Responses**:
  - Adjust the temperature setting to control the randomness of responses.
  - Review the max output tokens to ensure responses are not too long or too short.
- **Access Issues**:
  - If you do not see the AI Voice Agent option in your dashboard, contact **info@dasomx.com** to request access.
