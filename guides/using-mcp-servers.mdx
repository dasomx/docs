## Understanding MCP Servers

MCP servers act as bridges between your chatbot and external services, allowing it to:

- Access and manipulate data from various sources
- Integrate with third-party services
- Enhance the chatbot's functionality with real-time data

## Server Types

### Streamable HTTP (Recommended)

- **Recommended method** for connecting MCP servers
- Uses HTTP streaming for real-time communication
- Supported by [Zapier MCP Hub](https://mcp.zapier.com/) (Recommended)
- Also available through mcp.composio.dev
- Easy setup with pre-configured endpoints
- Better performance and reliability

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)

- Alternative connection method
- Real-time communication via SSE protocol
- Requires manual endpoint configuration
- Good for custom implementations

## Setting Up MCP Servers

### Getting Started

1. Navigate to your chatbot's MCP Servers page
2. Browse available server templates or add a custom server
3. Choose your preferred connection method

<Warning>
  Use claude 4 sonnet, gpt 4o, gemini 2.5 flash models for best results. Other
  models may not work as expected.
</Warning>

### Configuration Options

#### Option 1: Zapier MCP Hub (Recommended)

1. **Visit [Zapier MCP Hub](https://mcp.zapier.com/)**:

   - Easy-to-use interface for creating MCP endpoints
   - Pre-configured templates for popular services
   - Streamlined authentication process
   - **Recommended for most users**

2. **Get your endpoint**:

   - Click "New MCP Server"
   - Choose "Other" as client type
   - Select your desired service integration and tools
   - Navigate to "Connect" tab
   - Select "Streamable HTTP" as transport type
   - Copy the Server URL

3. **Install in your chatbot**:
   - Paste the endpoint URL in the server configuration
   - Set the server type to "Streamable HTTP (Recommended)"
   - Activate the server

#### Option 2: Composio MCP Servers

1. **Get the HTTP streaming endpoint**:

   - Visit [mcp.composio.dev](https://mcp.composio.dev)
   - Select your desired service
   - Choose "HTTP" as your platform
   - Copy the generated HTTP streaming endpoint URL

2. **Install the Server**:
   - Paste the HTTP streaming endpoint URL in the installation dialog
   - Configure server settings:
     - **Type**: Choose "Streamable HTTP (Recommended)" or "Server-Sent Events (SSE)"
     - **Active**: Enable/disable the server

#### Option 3: Custom Local Servers

For advanced users who want to run local MCP servers:

Run an MCP SSE proxy to turn your local MCP server into a remote one. This
[example repo](https://github.com/sparfenyuk/mcp-proxy) shows you how to run an MCP proxy to turn a local MCP server
into a remote / SSE MCP server. If you follow this route, you will need to
make sure you expose to appropriate ports via ngrok or similar tools.

### Authentication

For services requiring authentication (e.g., Google Sheets, Google Calendar):

#### Using Zapier MCP Hub (Recommended)

1. Authentication is handled during the Zapier setup process
2. Follow the authentication flow in the Zapier interface
3. Your credentials are securely managed by Zapier
4. Simply use the generated endpoint URL in your chatbot

#### Using Composio or Custom Endpoints

1. Click "Install" on the service
2. Enter the HTTP streaming endpoint URL
3. The authentication will be automatically associated with the URL
4. Simply chat with the chatbot to authenticate, for example ("authenticate with google sheets")
5. Visit the URL provided by the chatbot to complete the authentication process

<Note>
  MCP servers can be enable for public use (meaning through web chatbot, social
  media, etc.) by enabling the "Public" option in the server settings.
</Note>

## Important Concepts

### Active Servers Limit

- Maximum of 3 active MCP servers per chatbot
- This limit ensures optimal performance
- You can install more servers but only 3 can be active at once
- Toggle servers active/inactive as needed

### Public vs Private Servers

- **Public Servers**: Available for use by other chatbots
- **Private Servers**: Only accessible by your chatbot
- Consider making servers public if you want to share functionality

### Best Practices

1. **Server Management**:

   - **Use Zapier MCP Hub when possible** - it's the most user-friendly option
   - Choose "Streamable HTTP (Recommended)" for better performance
   - Keep only necessary servers active
   - Regularly review and update server configurations
   - Test server connections after setup

2. **Security**:

   - Prefer Zapier MCP Hub for secure credential management
   - Use authenticated endpoints for sensitive data
   - Keep authentication credentials secure
   - Review public/private settings regularly

3. **Performance**:
   - Streamable HTTP typically offers better performance than SSE
   - Monitor server response times
   - Deactivate unused servers
   - Use appropriate rate limits

## Quick Start Guide

For the fastest setup experience:

1. **Visit [Zapier MCP Hub](https://mcp.zapier.com/) (Recommended)**
2. **Choose your service** (Google Sheets, Trello, etc.)
3. **Follow the setup wizard** to create your endpoint
4. **Copy the generated URL**
5. **Go to your chatbot's MCP Servers page**
6. **Click "Add MCP Server"**
7. **Select "Streamable HTTP (Recommended)" as the type**
8. **Paste your Zapier endpoint URL**
9. **Activate the server**
10. **Start chatting!**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Problems**:

   - **For Zapier endpoints**: Check your Zapier account and endpoint status
   - **For Composio endpoints**: Verify the HTTP streaming endpoint URL and check server status at mcp.composio.dev
   - Ensure the server type matches your endpoint (Streamable HTTP vs SSE)
   - Verify the server is activated in your chatbot settings

2. **Authentication Errors**:

   - **Zapier**: Re-authenticate through the Zapier interface
   - **Composio**: Re-authenticate the service and check permission settings
   - Verify API access and rate limits

3. **Performance Issues**:

   - Try switching to "Streamable HTTP" if using SSE
   - Review active server count (max 3 active)
   - Check server logs and monitor rate limits
   - Consider using Zapier MCP Hub for better reliability

4. **Server Type Issues**:
   - Use "Streamable HTTP (Recommended)" for new setups
   - Legacy SSE servers can be updated to Streamable HTTP
   - Check endpoint compatibility with your chosen server type
