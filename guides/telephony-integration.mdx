  outgoing voice calls.
</Warning>

### Step 1: Access Telephony Settings

2. **Enter Phone Number Details**: Fill in your Twilio phone number and provide a descriptive label

### Step 3: Provider-Specific Configuration

#### Twilio Setup

For Twilio integration, you'll need:

- **Account SID**: Your Twilio Account SID (starts with "AC")
- **Auth Token**: Your Twilio Auth Token (keep this secure)

### Step 4: Configure Inbound Calling

After adding your phone number:

  must whitelist destination countries in your Twilio account. In your Twilio
  Console, search for **Programmable Voice**, then navigate to **Voice
  Geographic Permissions**. Select the countries you need from the **Low Risk**
  tab and save your changes.
